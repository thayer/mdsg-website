          <p>The behavior and performance of complex real-world systems is shaped by the interactions between multiple decision-makers and stakeholders. The Multi Decision-Maker Systems Group (MDSG) studies these interactions using Operations Research methods. </p>
	    <p>Our past and ongoing research projects encompass applications in aviation planning, aviation operations, highway traffic management, transit and urban planning, and healthcare operations planning, using optimization, game theory and data-driven modelling. Current projects include: </p>
          <h2>Airline Competition and Cooperation</h2>
          <p>Airlines make pricing and service decisions in a competitive environment. Fare, service frequency and route planning choices of different airlines across the air transportation network are interelated, and so have significant implications for the performance of the air transportation system as a whole. In addition, recent years have seen several major airline mergers, the formation of alliances, and allegations of ticket price collusion between major carriers. We use game-theoretic and statistical methods to model airline behavior, with a view toward informing forecasting, planning, and policy making. </p>
		  <h2>Aviation Delays and Crew Scheduling</h2>
          <p>Delays in air transportation systems often propagate, as tightly scheduled operations require craft, crew and connecting passengers from earlier flights. Crew-related delays in particular pose modeling challenges due the lack of publically available data. We develop models to evaluate the relationship between crew delays and delay propagation through the air transportation network, with the goal of informing strategies for delay mitigation.   </p>
		    <h2>Healthcare Service Resource Allocation</h2>
          <p>Healthcare networks serving diverse and geographically distributed populations often face significant capacity and demand imbalances. We collaborate with researchers and clinicians at the <a href="http://www.dartmouth-hitchcock.org/">Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC)</a> to develop simulation and optimization approaches for understanding healthcare service imbalances and improving healthcare delivery. </p>
